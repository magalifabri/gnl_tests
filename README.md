# GET_NEXT_LINE TESTER

A small number of rather basic tests for get_next_line

## Instructions
1. cd into the get_next_line directory
2. git clone https://github.com/magalifabri/gnl_tests.git
3. cd into the gnl_tests directory
4. ./test_script.sh
5. ./test_script_bonus.sh (optional)

Only works when the source files are directly in the get_next_line directory and not contained in a child source folder or something of the sort.
