# GET_NEXT_LINE TESTER

A small number of rather basic tests for get_next_line

## Instructions
1. cd into your get_next_line directory
2. `git clone https://github.com/magalifabri/gnl_tests.git`
3. `cd gnl_tests`
4. `./run_test.sh`
5. `./run_test_bonus.sh (optional)`

Only works when the source files are directly in the get_next_line directory and not contained in a child source folder or something of the sort.
