# GET_NEXT_LINE TESTER

A small number of rather basic tests for get_next_line.

*(And a script to also pull & run [Mazoise's 42TESTERS-GNL](https://github.com/Mazoise/42TESTERS-GNL))*

## Instructions
1. cd into your get_next_line directory
2. `git clone https://github.com/magalifabri/gnl_tests.git`
3. `cd gnl_tests`
4. `./run_test.sh`
5. `./run_test_valgrind.sh` (if you wanna go hard-mode)
6. `./run_test_bonus.sh` (if bonuses have been made)

Only works when the source files are directly in the get_next_line directory and not contained in a child source folder or something of the sort.
